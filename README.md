# ht-home-webserver
A Node.js server to display humidity and temperature data at home

Currently pulling pre-inserted test data from a MySQL database, until I get the Arduino component working. Need to acquire a new Arduino that has either onboard Ethernet or wifi, so I can utilize this library: https://github.com/ChuckBell/MySQL_Connector_Arduino

Then I'll be able to populate the database with live temperature data!
